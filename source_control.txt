This program tracks the stats of creatures in a game called Ark. I find this interesting because there is a lot to consider when it comes to calculating the stats for your
dinos when it comes to breeding.

https://github.com/bavalia/euclidean_4D_visualizer
This github repo displays 4D objects in 2D and 3D space. I find this interesting because I have always wondered what 4D would look like and the fact that this is an
open source project that I can download and experiment with is cool.
